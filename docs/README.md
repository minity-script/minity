# Minity
> A scripting language for Vanilla Minecraft

## What it is

Minity is a scripting language which compiles to Vanilla Minecraft datapacks. It will allow you to develop complex datapacks in just a few files, and make your work easier by providing intuitive syntax for using some of the most powerful, but also hardest to use, Minecraft commands.
